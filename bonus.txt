I want to investigate if the latitude and longitude of a POI are linear related to its count, radius or density.\

Hypotheses: \
\
1.  \outl0\strokewidth0 latitude and longitude of a POI are linear related to its count\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \
2.\outl0\strokewidth0 latitude and longitude of a POI are linear related to its radius\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \
3.\outl0\strokewidth0 latitude and longitude of a POI are linear related to its density\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \

Testing steps:\
The testing steps are similar: using sklearn to do linear regression.  X = (lat, lon), y = (count/radius/density) \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 We can get the intercept , coefficient and r_squared score. If the score is not promising, then choose another model to do regression. (Intercept, coefficient and r_squared score are in python code 4.2)\

\
Conclusions:\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0  Based on r_square score which is 1 in each case, we can find that latitude and longitude are linear related to count, radius and density.  However, the conclusion may not be convincing because we just have three different POI geo info and we only use r squared to select models.\
We should add more POI to confirm our thoughts. One solution is that we can set POI ourself, calculate its count, radius and density based on our dataset and do testing and training. Additionally, we should use more statistical measure to select models.\

\cf0                     Additional idea:\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-1931\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \outl0\strokewidth0 It is shown that the province distribution of requests for each POI is not even(e.g: All requests in AB are labeled POI1POI2, most of requests in QC are labeled POI3, all requests in NS are labeled POI4). The reason is that we label requests based on distance which is affected by geo location. \
